# Index-Binary-Search-Tree
Takes in a file, finds every occurrence of the word, line number, and alphabetizes each word using binary search tree.
Each node contains the word, occurence, and a list of line numbers. The program reads in the file by each word and line number (excludes punctuation) and adds the node if it is a unique occurence to the binary search tree. If the word already exists, the existing node with the same word's occurence and line number is updated.
